Rules Governing New Levels:  LucasArts is under no obligation to make any features in the Game that will allow you to create New Levels.

New Levels may be permitted by LucasArts, in its sole discretion, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the following additional conditions:


(1)     New Levels may work only if used in combination with the retail version of the Game, and may not work with any demo or Original Equipment Manufacturer (generally known as "OEM") versions of the Game.  New Levels may not be designed to be used as a stand-alone product.

(2)     New Levels may not modify any COM, EXE, DLL or other executable files.  

(3)     New Levels must not contain any illegal, scandalous, illicit, defamatory, libelous, or objectionable material (as may be determined by LucasArts in its sole discretion), or any material that infringes any trademarks, copyrights, protected works, publicity, proprietary, or other rights of any third party or of LucasArts.

ELEMENTS TM & (C) LUCASARTS, A DIVISION OF LUCASFILM ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY LTD."  

(6)     New Levels may not be sold, bartered, or distributed with any other product for which any charge is made (other than incidental charges for time spent on-line), but rather must be distributed free of charge at all times. 

(7)     By distributing or permitting the distribution of any New Levels, all creators or owners of any trademark, copyright, or other right, title or interest therein: (a) grant to LucasArts an irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, sublicensable right to distribute or exploit the New Level by any means or media (whether now known or hereafter invented), and to create and distribute by any means or media (whether now known or hereafter invented) derivative works thereof, and to charge for the distribution of such New Level or such derivative work, with no obligation to account to any creators or owners of the New Level in any manner, and (b) waive and covenant not to assert in any forum any and all moral rights (including, without limitation, rights of paternity, attribution, integrity, and participation), and authorize LucasArts to publish and exploit the New Levels (including any portions and derivatives thereof) in its sole discretion without attributing any of the foregoing to me or identifying me in connection therewith.

THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS DEPENDING ON THE LAWS IN YOUR STATE.  


This Agreement is governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California between California residents, and you hereby consent to personal jurisdiction in California.  This Agreement will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. You and LucasArts each agree that any claim or controversy arising out of this Agreement or the Software shall be settled by expedited binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.  Such arbitration shall take place in Marin County, California, and you waive any claim that such forum is inconvenient.  Any such claim or controversy shall be arbitrated solely on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated with a claim of any other party.  The arbitrator may not change the terms of this Agreement.  The arbitrator may award injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce the terms hereof; provided, however, that no injunctive or equitable relief may be awarded that would enjoin or impair LucasArts' rights or ability to distribute or otherwise market, advertise, promote or exploit the Software.  If it is judicially determined that any claim or controversy arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Software cannot be settled by expedited binding arbitration as noted above, then you agree that any such claims or controversies shall be brought and maintained in the state courts located within the County of Marin, State of California or the federal courts of the Northern District of California, and you waive any claim that either such forum is inconvenient.  The foregoing shall not preclude LucasArts from seeking any injunctive or other relief for protection of LucasArts' intellectual property rights or similar rights in any court of competent jurisdiction.  This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between you and LucasArts with respect to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided herein, this Agreement may not be amended except in a writing signed by both parties; provided, however, that LucasArts has the right, without notice and/or without a writing signed by both parties, to amend this Agreement in connection with any modifications or updates to the Software.
